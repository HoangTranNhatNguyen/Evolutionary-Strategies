# Evolutionary-Strategies
An implementation of "Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning"

## This implementation supports
- PyTorch-GPU
- Compute gradients w.r.t. mean and standard deviation (the original paper used a constant standard deviation)
- Import/Export parameters to working models

*Note: ES is very sensitive to hyper-parameters such as population size, mean, standard deviation, and learning rate.*

## To do
Implementing Novelty Search "Improving Exploration in Evolution Strategies for Deep Reinforcement Learning via a Population of Novelty-Seeking Agents"
